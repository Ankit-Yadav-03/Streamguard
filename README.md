# Streamguard
StreamGuard is a self-hosted control plane for LLM streaming that prevents token bleed when clients disconnect. It enforces cancellation, bounded backpressure, strict accounting cutoffs, and produces audit-grade receipts showing prevented spend. Validated against real streaming LLMs (Ollama).
